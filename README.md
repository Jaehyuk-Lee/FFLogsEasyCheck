[Download the latest release here.](https://github.com/RuinIv/FFLogsEasyCheck/releases/latest)

I would also like to address that this is a tool meant to help players who enjoy raiding and parsing more easily check players FFLogs for the purpose of gathering data on that player's experience in the fight and meant to enable those players to more accuratly make desicions that will improve the party's chance of clearing. It is **NOT** a tool meant to enable kneejerk kicking of players whose logs dont meet your standards. Please give all players who are able to join your party with the gates you set up in Party Finder a fair chance in your party!

## Setup
1. Drag the plugin dll into your normal ACT plugin directory (%APPDATA%\Advanced Combat Tracker\Plugins).

2. Add the plugin to ACT.

3. Configure the plugin by selecting the home region and server for the character your are logged in as.

**Note:** If you have different characters that are on a different server from your main character, or if your permenently transfer your main character to another server, you will need to reconfigure the plugin so that the home region and home server settings are always correct. You do not need to reconfigure when you visit other worlds.

## Optional Settings
#### Show Notification
- Option for whether or not to show the notification in the corner of your screen when someone joins your party. Toggle this to disable notifications if you want to hide them without disabling the plugin.

#### Auto Open Logs
- Option for automatically opening a new party member's FFLogs profile in your browser without having to interact with anything.
